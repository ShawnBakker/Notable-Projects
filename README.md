# Notable-Projects
Projects completed using Python and C (so far), IDE's inclusive of VSC and VIM.

Any projetcts listed here were completed by me and the solutions given per each project did not allow the use of built-in functions a majority of the time, 
An example of no built-ins would be Projects 2E and 2D, and many more
Other websites were used to find methods for sorting and hash methods, but were never used to directly solve a given problem.
Please refer to my contact information if there are any questions or clarifications regarding my code.

All solutions are 100% correct and have been checked by a GE or a professor to ensure total completion and precision.
